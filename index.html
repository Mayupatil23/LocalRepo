<!-- Init Command -->
<!-- Init - used to create a new git repo -->
<!-- command = git init 
     git remote add origin <- link->

     git remote -v (to verify remote origin)

     git branch (to check branch) (master was the default branch earlier now its main)

     git branch -M main (main is the new name of the branch) (to rename the branch)

     git checkout <- branch name -> (to navigate)

     git cheackout -b <- new branch name -> (to create a new branch)

     git branch -d <- branch name -> (to delete branch)

     git push origin main

     git push -u origin main ("-u" means upstream which used instead of "origin main" that is 
        understood as all the push operations are to be done in the origin main only, Now you don't
        have to write the whole command everytime you use thr push command )-->


<!-- Git Branches
     Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained 
     area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. 
     eg. if you wanna add a feature into your repo you can create a branch from the main project 
     add the feature and then you can also merge it into the main program-->

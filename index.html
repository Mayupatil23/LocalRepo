<p>This is a new Repo</p>

<!-- Init Command -->
<!-- Init - used to create a new git repo -->
<!-- command = git init 
     git remote add origin <- link->
     git remote -v (to verify remote origin)
     git branch (to check branch) (master was the default branch earlier now its main)
     git branch -M main (main is the new name of the branch) (to rename the branch)
     git push origin main
     git push -u origin main ("-u" means upstream which used instead of "origin main" that is 
        understood as all the push operations are to be done in the origin main only, Now you don't
        have to write the whole command everytime you use thr push command )-->
